🎓 AquaGuard – AI-Powered Beach Safety System
I’m proud to present our graduation project, AquaGuard, which was awarded an A+ at Ain Shams University (2025).
AquaGuard is an intelligent beach safety system that leverages drone surveillance, deep learning, and computer vision to detect and alert for three major coastal hazards:
🏊‍♂ Drowning incidents
🦈 Shark presence
🌊 Rip currents

#Key Modules & Technologies
1. Drowning Detection
Uses transformer-based video classifiers to recognize potential drowning behavior
Employs DeepSORT and ConvNeXt-Tiny for real-time person tracking
2. Shark & Human Detection
Utilizes YOLOv11 for object detection in aquatic environments
3. Rip Current Classification
Fine-tuned ResNet-50 model to classify rip currents from aerial footage
4. Integrated Alert System
Backend built with FastAPI, optimized for GPU acceleration
Mobile alerts delivered via a Flutter-based app to notify lifeguards instantly
